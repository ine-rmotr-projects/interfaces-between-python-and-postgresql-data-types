Alternately, you might wish to use a Docker container for a self-contained installation.  See `https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres` for details on that option.  Unless you have a specific need to work with an existing installation, choosing a PostgreSQL version of 12 or higher is best.\n",

    "Python variables and attributes are dynamically typed, but each individual value has a strict type.  We sometimes are presented with collections of Python collections, and would like to determine good data layout for this data in PosgreSQL automatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this task, assume that your Python data is in the form of an iterable of namedtuples.  After analyzing data input, your function should product a PostgreSQL SQL statement to create a proposed table.  Obviously, emphasizing that this inference is a guess is important, since future Pyton data produced in the same application may not be compatible with the schema. In use, the function should operate in a manner similar to the below:\n",

    "    e TEXT\n",
    ");\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "At the least, the proposed schema should be compatible with the data actually encountered.  If you decide it is not possible to unify the data in a single data definition, you should raise an appropriate exception.  Several sample datasets are provided for you to test against.  You should expand these for more robust testing, especially to consider additional edge cases."
